VERSIONING

Current latest version: 0.5

	NASCA V0.5
	Entire site has been consolidated to a single HTML page that is dynamically animated and updated as the user uses
	the nav bar. The site now uses a fixed nav bar. The algorithm that handles interactive transcripts under INTERVIEWS
	has been overhauled to be less buggy, less computationally hungry, and more responsive. PHP is beginning to be implemented
	to access data from contentDM, and facilitate dynamic content on the web page. 'HOME', 'INTERVIEWS', 'TIMELINE', and
	'MAP' are considered complete.
