		<a data-largesrc="img/tribesLogos/pee_dee_nation.png" data-title="Pee Dee Nation" data-description="Pee Dee Today: The Pee Dee Indian Nation is a small American Indian tribe officially recognized by the State of South Carolina. The tribe was one of the first two American Indian tribes to receive official recognition from the state. The tribe's population consists of more than 800 enrolled members and tribal land is located in Little Rock, South Carolina, along the Little Pee Dee River.  The tribe is an active member of the South Carolina Native American Affairs Advisory Committee, and numerous tribal members are affiliated with national and regional American Indian rights groups and advocacy organizations. The tribe strives to empower its members through the continued practice of cultural traditions, economic development efforts centered around strategic business and community partnerships, as well as advocacy work aimed at educating public policy makers regarding both national and regional American Indian issues. Additionally, 100% of the tribe’s members who are eligible to vote are certified registered voters. Farming has always been an extremely important aspect of Pee Dee existence and culture. Due to the significant and sacred position that land and nature continue to hold, most Pee Dee live predominately rural lives that are heavily intertwined within the local agriculture-based economy and community. However, in response to an ever evolving world many Pee Dee have successfully sought economic and career opportunities that fall outside of the tribe’s traditional agrarian roots. Apart from attending secondary educational institutions, today many Pee Dee proudly contribute to the local community as educators, law enforcement officers, nurses, artists, military servicemen/servicewomen, elected officials and small business owners. Frequent cultural, religious and administrative tribal events have allowed newer generations of Pee Dee to remain connected to their identity and culture, while simultaneously allowing them to pursue an array of new opportunities.

		<a data-largesrc="img/tribesLogos/sumter.png" data-title="Sumter Indians" data-description="The Cheraw Indians are a Siouan people who speak a dialect of the Dakota Sioux language very similar to the Catawba tribe.From ancient times the Cheraw maintained villages stretching from the north central section of North Carolina to the upper reaches of the Pee Dee River in South Carolina.In 1710 the Cheraw were forced out of their northern villages by repeated raids from the Iroquois. The Cheraw lived here at the border of North and South Carolina for many generations and maintained villages spread from Robeson County, North Carolina to as far south as the Wateree river.In 1712 nearly every able-bodied Cheraw male joined with the South Carolina colonists in their war against the Tuscarora, a tribe that had long been an enemy of the Cheraw. Early historian Rivers estimated the Cheraw population in 1715 to be approximately 140 fighting age men and 370 women, children, and elderly.In 1701 Welsh Baptists arrived on the ship William & Mary in Philadelphia. 30 years later they removed as a group to the south and settled briefly in Marion County, South Carolina. Here many of the Welsh encountered the Cheraw Indians who were suffering greatly from disease, constant raids by the Seneca and other Northern Indians, and several years of failed crops. A large number of Cheraw had already begun moving west to join their friends, the Catawba, as early as 1726, and the remainder greatly desired disposing of their lands and joining their tribesmen among the Catawba. In 1737 the Welsh and the South Carolina House of Commons treated with the Cheraw Indians and negotiated the relinquishment of a large parcel of land that became known as the “Welsh Tract.” Here in 1738 they erected the “Welsh Neck Baptist Church” which, in 1782, was renamed the “Cheraw Hill Baptist Church.”In 1759 a party of 45 Cheraw warriors, under the leadership of their chief “King Johnny”, joined the English in the expedition against Fort Duquesne. After the conclusion of the French and Indian War in 1763 a large number of Cheraw decided not to return to the Catawba reservation, but instead resettled in their ancient homeland in north central North Carolina between the Tar and Roanoke rivers, and it is here, at the border between Northampton and Halifax counties, that many of them later volunteered for service in the American Revolution.In 1776, three Cheraw Indian men, James Scott, David Scott, and Isham Scott, all close cousins, joined the North Carolina Continental Line. James was assigned to the 3rd Regiment, David to the 2nd Regiment, and Isham to the 10th Regiment.All three of these Cheraw Scotts, while serving in the North Carolina Continental Line, had spent some time training in the High Hills of Santee between 1779 and 1780. They must have found the area to their liking as, after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, all three brought their families down from North Carolina. Tagging along with the Scotts was Aaron Oxendine, a Cheraw Indian of Robeson, North Carolina, son-in-law of James Scott and nephew of Isham Scott’s wife. And thus the Cheraw Indians returned to mid-lands South Carolina after a nearly 50-year absence.In consideration of their veteran status, General Thomas Sumter employed these Indian-blooded families in his farming and manufacturing endeavors, testified in support of their Revolutionary War veterans’ pensions, and allowed them to reside on his land. In 1809 General Sumter deeded 24 acres of his personal land as a gift to James Scott, one of the few non family members to inherit land from the famous General.We descendants of those Cheraw Indians continued to reside in Sumter County, and maintained our own distinct community for over 150 years. We built a church, and general store to serve our people, and the State established a 'special school' for us, separate from the white and black schools of the County.The Sumter tribe of Cheraw Indians is a modern political representation of that ancient Cheraw Indian inheritance. Our goal is to educate the public regarding our history, culture, traditions, crafts, and unique way of life.">

Although the inhabitants of the Dimery settlement conducted business and existed as a separate community throughout the years, it wasn’t until 1992 that a formal organization was formed to protect the history and traditions of our people.The tribe was chartered as a non-profit organization in October of 1992, with the initial organizational meeting held on October 17, 1992. At this meeting, the original founders relinquished all control to the tribal council. The word “Chicora” was added in January 1993 by a majority vote of the governing council. This addition was intended to define the area of our people and to establish the boundaries of the Waccamaw. In January of 2002, the tribal community voted to eliminate the term “Chicora” from its name in order to avoid confusion with another group in the area using the word to denote their people.

Not all of these folks were swept away by the years of war in the 1700s. They laid down their weapons in the 1800s after signing treaty after treaty until they had nothing else to give. They picked up the plow; they banded together to save what was left of a once great Cherokee Nation. These folks stepped forward into the 1800s and embraced the challenge that lay before them. Mimicking their white neighbors, our grandparents gathered in the Upstate of South Carolina. In Walhalla, Pickens, Greenville, Spartanburg, and Laurens, they worked their farms while hiding in plain sight. Not all were on the Trail of Tears, not all left the area. They stayed and worked through the 1800s passing along the culture of their forebears as best they could while learning to survive in the White world. They sent their children off to the American Civil War and wars in Europe and Asia in the 1900s. As a people we have fought in every war the United States has ever fought in. The 1980s found our families working together for the betterment of all Indian People in South Carolina. Uniting together as the Piedmont American Indian Association, along with the Council of Native Americans, to help foster a better understanding of Indian people, to share Native American legacy and culture, to keep traditions alive to pass on to future generations, and to bring recognition of Indian People in the state of South Carolina.  Those great-great-great-grandchildren became chartered in the State as PAIA in 1984 and were recognized by Governor Richard Riley in 1985. In 2000 the PAIA became the Piedmont American Indian Association Lower Eastern Cherokee Nation of South Carolina in order to gain legal status for the tribal part of the organization. The PAIA Lower Eastern Cherokee Nation became a South Carolina State Recognized Group on August 21, 2008 and then a South Carolina State Recognized Tribe on June 19, 2015. ">
