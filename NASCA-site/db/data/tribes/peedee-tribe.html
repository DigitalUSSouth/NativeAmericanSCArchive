		We continue the struggle to help our people. For many years we have pushed through boundaries not easily broken, with the the support of all those past and present. Even though there is a long way to go, as a Tribe we should be proud.

		The Pee Dee Indians have left their mark throughout history in many forms.  Our people lived along a stretch of river known as The Great Pee Dee River, which is named after our people.  In the past and present there have been archeological digs which show proof of our presence. The Pee Dee's have fought in every war and conflict from the Revolution to wars of the present. We have many veterans and active duty tribal members that have served in the United States Armed Forces with honor and distinction, defending the security of our Nation.  We have contributed immeasurably to our country and our heritage; distinguishing ourselves as scholars, artists, entrepreneurs, and leaders in all aspects of American society.

		Yet our communities face unrelenting realities, including extremely high rates of poverty, unemployment, crime, and disease.  It is necessary to acknowledge our history and current challenges if we are to ensure that our children have an equal opportunity to pursue the American Dream.  It is our responsibility to see our tribal community continue to grow.

		At this time we are not receiving any type of federal or state assistance.  Our only means of income as a Tribe is from the generosity of those that make donations. We are a non-profit organization. All monies received are used to help with the running of the tribe. Our tribe at this time does not have paying positions.  Monies received are used to pay tribal costs, such as utilities and office supplies.  Our goal is to be in a position to offer assistance to tribal members in need in the future.

		The Tribe was chartered in South Carolina on November 29, 1976 as an Indian Tribe.  It took 29 years and 9 months to receive this long awaited recognition.  On August 29, 2006 a Certificate of Recognition was awarded to The Pee Dee Indian Tribe of SC.
