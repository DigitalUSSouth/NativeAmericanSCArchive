		In later years the term Croatan Indian was used as a derogatory term to indicate mixed blood Indians. Nevertheless, many of our people claimed to be Croatan Indian because it provided the only separation available for them from the Blacks and the Whites. Evidence of this is recorded on almost all birth certificates issued by the state of South Carolina to Santee Indians, it clearly states their race. Many Indians believed they could not draw social security and were not protected by the law. People tend to identify with those who possess the same features and traits, and because we didn’t fit with either Black or White, we banded with our own. The United States racial condition during that time caused the Santee Indians to create their own school. The school was called Crane Pond Elementary School. This school was located in Holly Hill, South Carolina the same White Oak area of the 1700’s. This school educated up to the 7th grade. South Carolina State Law only allowed Whites and Blacks to be educated to a 12th grade education. This schools name was later changed to the Santee Live Oak Indian School and was closed in 1966 at the end of racial segregation. Eighty children were enrolled the last year it was open.

		The Santee Tribe also created their own church in the same location as the Crane Pond elementary School in 1917. The land was purchased by a group of Santee Indians to build a “Church of God” for their community. This church building is still active today.
