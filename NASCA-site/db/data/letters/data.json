Allen Harris then came to me and wisht to go with me to Haywood as he had lived two years there and was acquainted with the rout and the whereabouts of the Indians and he is an intelligent Indian. I thought it would be to the interest of the state to take him with me and so agreed to pay his expenses if he wold find his own horse, when he met me he had a cattisll?  and horse and his little daughter 9 years of age he said she was so anctious to see her grandmother that he was obliged to take her with him.
