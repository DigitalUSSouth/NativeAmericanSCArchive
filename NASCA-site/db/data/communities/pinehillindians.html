		A Brief History of Pine Hill Indian Tribe: The First People of Fort Jackson, South Carolina<br />COPYRIGHT © 2018 by Michelle Mitchum

  <div class="tribes-history-desc">
		Pine Hill Indian Tribe was established in Pine Hill Indian Community in Orangeburg County, South Carolina as a result of final removal from our tribal land at present day Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Over time, our land was called Tallimeco, Colonel’s Creek and Kingville.

		The origin of the Pine Hill Indian Tribe predates South Carolina’s colonial period within the chiefdom of Cofitachique. The territory is recorded in the explorations of Hernando de Soto (1540) and Juan Pardo (1566-1568), the expedition by Dr. Henry Woodward at the direction of the Lords Proprietors (1670) and finally prospected by Maurice Matthews at the direction of Lord Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury (1671). When the Earl of Shaftesbury and Sir Peter Colleton established their own trade factories within the Province of Carolina, the Cofitachequi chiefdom was threatened by the regulated trade established with the Westo Indians. The most valuable trade item was human. The chiefdom was decentralized and deregulated.

		Colonists, specifically the Goose Creek Men, fueled the Westo War in 1680 to establish local colonial trade and to involuntarily induct Native Americans into slavery and human trafficking. Since colonists could not legally enslave anyone, they instead incited wars between tribal settlements so the tribal nations would have ‘prisoners of war’ to purchase through Indian trade. The colonists insisted, to the Lords Proprietors, that the Native American prisoners agreed to being enslaved locally rather than be exported to Caribbean Island sugar plantations. Colonial slaves, both Native American and African American, were not allowed to be baptized because English law dictated that that Christians could not be enslaved. As a result, all people of color were denied religion through dehumanization.

	<div class="tribes-history-desc">
		By 1700 the chiefdom was reduced by systematic colonial politics and the populations of tribal settlements were referred to as Settlement Indians, although John Lawson referred to us as scattered Congaree Indians settlements in 1701. The Journals of the Commissioners of Indian Trade record the relationship with our people and our first independent business agreement with Capt. James Moore, Jr. to establish trade, including the value of items traded, and the establishment of a fortified trading post built in 1718 called Fort Congaree. The first treaty with our people was in 1721, established by Gov. Sir Francis Nicholson, identifying us as Cherokee. Treaties continued to be engaged for many years, and our people suffered from the double standard of being free people of color within a State controlling people of color under the Negro Act of 1740. We were free enough to engage treaties but also dark enough to be forced into the “black” ethnic race until all people of color experienced the controlled freedom found at the end of the Civil War, over a century later.

		In years to follow the 1721 treaty, the infant country of America and infant colony of South Carolina edged toward a war for independence from the Crown of England. During the Revolutionary War, it is alleged Col. George Washington stayed at least one night on our land. The area became known as Colonel’s Creek.

	<div class="tribes-history-desc">
		By 1800, the Colonel’s Creek Missionary Baptist Church was formed. Rev. Jacob Higgins, sympathetic to our people, formally organized the church by building a log house on his land for the purpose of church services in 1840. The church accommodated all local parishioners, both white and ‘of color’ without any known implication of discrimination. The church and cemetery was established near our burial mound, as recorded in the 1936 Works Progress Administration Survey of State and Local Historical Records held by the University of South Carolina, South Carolinian Library.

		By 1821, the “Deer Pond” school was established. By 1829 a post office was established at Colonel’s Creek, later called Kingville and still operating almost consecutively until 1915. By 1840 the community was developed as part of the rail line from Charleston to Columbia, South Carolina. The South Carolina Railroad laid tracks and a train depot was established at Kingville (also called Kingsville), the anglicized name of the former Tallimeco (translated “the king’s town”). By 1860, the Kingsville Hotel was in operation.

		While mainstream society focused on economic politics, Indian removal became formalized. The Indian Removal Act was signed into effect by President Andrew Jackson in 1830. Our ancestor, John Fields, was a member of the Treaty Party and signed the 1835 Treaty of New Echota that invoked the infamous Trail of Tears. He effectively signed his own death warrant. He was beaten to death. His widow started a shingle mill.

	<div class="tribes-history-desc">
		During the Civil War, the area served as a confederate supply stop and wayside hospital established by the Young Ladies’ Hospital Association. A National Register of Historic Places survey records that during this war the area suffered extreme destruction by fire at the hands of troops commanded by General Edward E. Potter. 
	</div>
	<div class="tribes-history-desc">
		During the Reconstruction Period, our tribal area became known as Centre (or Center) Township and was the failed experimental project intended to keep former slaves together on land confiscated by former slave owners. People of color in our area were targeted by hate groups called the Klu Klux Klan, the Radical Republicans, and the Red Shirts.

		As early as 1898 the area found itself the location of several Army tent camps. By the end of the Spanish-American War, the Columbia Chamber of Commerce saw an economic advantage and began plans for a permanent Army base. The Chamber began pushing to purchase the land that finally became Camp Jackson, and local financial institutions started foreclosures. The United States Government, unable to secure ‘peaceful’ sales terms to purchase lands owners refused to sell, initiated condemnation litigation and sought to quiet title of all of the land acquired. Our tribe was forced off of our tribal land. A separate litigation surrounding the Fields Tract of our tribal land went to the South Carolina Supreme Court. Camp Jackson was formally activated in 1917 but was deactivated in 1921, and then reactivated in 1939 as Fort Jackson.
	</div>
	<div class="tribes-history-desc">
		Our identified ancestors, specifically buried at Colonel’s Creek Missionary Baptist Church, were removed through further litigation by 1959 without our knowledge (this became known to our tribe in 2013). Our historical sites are repeatedly studied by archaeologists and are known to be a haven for a significant number of Native American artifacts. In 1995, thousands of artifacts, dated as long ago as 11,500 – 9,900 B.C., were inventoried in a report titled “An Archaeological Collections Summary for Fort Jackson, South Carolina.” Additional archaeological studies have been done since 1995, unearthing thousands more artifacts. However, only the Catawba Nation is actively notified of developments of the area. Programmatic Agreements between the South Carolina State Historic Preservation Office, Fort Jackson Garrison Commander, and at least 12 federally recognized tribes are renewed to manage our historical tribal land, but we have never been consulted to participate in any activities on our tribal land.

	<div class="tribes-history-desc">
		Forced to remove from our tribal land, we migrated to Orangeburg County into what is now called Pine Hill Indian Community. Our people attended the Pine Hill Indian School, which was dismantled without our consultation in 2017. Struggling to find work, our people turned to Indian Field Indian Community seeking refuge at the Coachman Indian Reservation held in trust by the State of South Carolina, and worked as far as the Charleston Port Authority. 
	</div>
	<div class="tribes-history-desc">
		Remaining in Pine Hill Indian Community in the rural northwestern part of Orangeburg County, our tribal members have endured social disparities of the times resulting from Jim Crow laws and the Great Depression. We have endured discrimination through civil rights activities, the Orangeburg Massacre, the Klu Klux Klan burning crosses in tribal members’ yards, left to die on the roadway, and the sale of our children. 
	</div>
	<div class="tribes-history-desc">
		In 2003, South Carolina recognized our tribe. In 2013, we successfully established the location of our original tribal land. Fort Jackson welcomed our return with a publication. We celebrate this acknowledgement by the federal government. 
	</div>
	<div class="tribes-history-desc">
		As of 2018, Pine Hill Indian Tribe is a member of the South East American Indian Council, Native American Youth Coalition of South Carolina, Carolina Heritage Association, and Keepers of the Word Ministry. We actively work with University of South Carolina – Lancaster Native American Studies Program. We are actively engaged in mutual aid with the Beaver Creek Indians, Yamassee Indian Tribe, Etiwan Tribe of the Wassamasaw Indian Nation, and Indian Field Indian Community.
