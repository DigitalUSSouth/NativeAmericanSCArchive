Before I started to Haywood County, NC I went in to Mecklenburg County, NC where I knew old Billy Ayers had removed to, and bought some land and settled on, but when I go their, I found he was dead and his children left and gone to Haywood . He bought 10 acres of land and it was worn out and but of little value He was an old industrious Catawba. I search then after those in Chester District So. Ca. and found as you will see on the exhibit C. I then went onto the plantation owned by the state and found as you will see on the paper exhibit C. Allen Harris then came to me and wisht to go with me to Haywood as he had lived two years there and was acquainted with the rout and the whereabouts of the Indians and he is an intelligent Indian. I thought it would be to the interest of the state to take him with me and so agreed to pay his expenses if he wold find his own horse, when he met me he had a cattisll?  and horse and his little daughter 9 years of age he said she was so anctious to see her grandmother that he was obliged to take her with him. I agreed to it and we started on the 3rd of Sept. and we arrived at Ashville N.C. on Friday 7th. Allen Harris came to me after we had been there about 2 ours and said he had heard of a Catawba Indian \n\n","descri":"Agent report and list of Catawba Indians residing near Echota mission church in Cherokee, NC.","creato":"B.S.
