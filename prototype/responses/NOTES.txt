Currently being used in the following places:

archive/views.py

	SubmitArchiveEntry(FormResponseView)

		This is to handle ajax and regular form submits dynamically
		so you may include this in a modal + ajax submit for a 
		smoother file upload, rather than transitioning all the way
		to a new view etc

search_utils.py

	Everything here inherits from AjaxGetView in order to return
	the constants needs for the dynamic search bar functionality

	You can see an example of this by going to localhost:8000/archive/
	and playing with the search bar there.

	The jquery / javascript that implements this is located in:

		static/js/archive/search_form.js
